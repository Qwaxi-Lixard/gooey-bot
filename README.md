Gooey is a small personal bot I am writing to help manage some stuff on my discord.

# Task

Some basic task Gooey can do:

- [x] Speaks to you when you say "hey gooey".
- [ ] Knows how to create role menus.
- [x] Knows how to varify people's age using RegEx
- [x] Knows how to give/take roles on command
- [ ] You can tell Gooey to stop doing task.

# Development

To extend Gooey Bot yourself, you'll first need to install [Deno](https://deno.land) and create yourself your own [Discord Bot](https://discord.com/developers). Finally, Gooey Bot is built using [Harmony](https://github.com/harmonyland/harmony) to access Discord's API.
